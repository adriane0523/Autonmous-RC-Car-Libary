# Autonmous-RC-Car-Libary
<h1>ASU Embedded Systems Project</h1>
<p>This for CSE 325 Fall 2019. This was our final code for the project and is on this repo for demo purposes. </p>

</p>This was for an Embedded Microprocessor Systems Class at ASU. The goal was to build an RC Car that can autonomously navigate around obstacles. The RC car had an FRDM-KE02Z40M microcontroller, distance sensors, Adafruit GPS, LCD & Button Shield, and IMU module. Our group focused on programming and implementing the GPS module, the obstacle avoidance algorithm, and the car driving library. The car successfully navigates the obstacle 6/10 of the time. Our group achieved an A for the successful implementation of GPS and other modules.</p>
